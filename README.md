# learning-to-py
Learning Python and a complete beginner. Not even sure what a repository is yet.

Literally haven't a clue. Hoping to achieve:

Somewhere to put code and update it.
Using pylint to check stuff, though not quite sure what for yet.
Allow someone else to run my code on the web. Is that possible?
